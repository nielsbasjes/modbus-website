## Sunspec Webinar (2025-07-31)

https://sunspec.org/events/register-now-unlocking-modbus-accelerating-adoption-with-sunspec-devkit-open-source-tools/

> Unlocking Modbus: Accelerate Adoption with SunSpec DevKit and Open Source Tools
> Presented by SunSpec Alliance
> 
> Modbus is everywhere in the solar and DER landscape, but turning its raw binary output into usable, structured data can be a nightmare. In this upcoming SunSpec webinar, a panel of developers and open-source technologists will explore how new tools and community-driven libraries are transforming Modbus from a tangle of bits into developer-friendly, standards-aligned data streams.
> 
> Join us for a practical and technically rich session featuring:
> 
> - **Niels Basjes**, a seasoned IT Architect and cybersecurity innovator at bol.com and a member of several Apache open-source project teams, will introduce his new Modbus Schema Toolkit—an open-source solution designed to map Modbus registers to human-readable formats using schema-based logic. Originally developed to streamline data extraction from his own heat pump, this toolkit now makes integrating SunSpec-compliant devices with platforms like Home Assistant nearly effortless.
> - **Peter Grace**, former Site Reliability Engineer at Reddit and Director of IT at StackOverflow, now DevOps engineer at StackBlitz, will walk through his creation of sunspec_rs, a Rust-based Modbus parser for SunSpec data, and sunspec_gateway, which bridges Modbus to MQTT for seamless integration with modern home automation systems. Born from frustration with the lack of reliable tools during his own residential solar install, Peter’s approach demonstrates how developers can reclaim control of their energy data pipelines.
> - **Vish Ganti**, President and COO of DERSecurity Corp, will provide insight into how schema-based approaches and open-source collaboration can enhance interoperability, security, and developer access across the DER ecosystem.
> 
> Whether you’re a system integrator, home energy enthusiast, or software engineer, this webinar will offer valuable takeaways on making Modbus data useful, portable, and scalable, especially when paired with SunSpec-compliant equipment.
> 
> Don’t miss this deep dive into the tools and techniques that are making Modbus usable in the real world.

My part of the webinar starts at about 00:07:50

## SpacesSummit 2024 (2024-09-30)

In 2024 the company I work for ([bol.com](https://partner.bol.com/click/click?p=2&t=url&s=2483&f=TXL&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bol.com%2Fnl%2Fnl%2F&name=Modbus)) held an internal IT Conference where I gave a presentation about "[The dark side of Green Energy APIs](https://youtu.be/CHVktAbJbHc)" which is all about modbus and this project.
